=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Config::Git - Plugin configuration containing settings for a Git repo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    [Config::Git / Git::main]
    remote        = origin
    local_branch  = master
    remote_branch = master
    allow_dirty   = dist.ini
    allow_dirty   = README
    allow_dirty   = qr{\w+\.ini}
    changelog     = Changes
 
    [Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch]
    git_config = Git::main
 
    [@Git]
    git_config = Git::main
 
    ; etc.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a configuration plugin for Git repoE<sol>branch information.  A configuration plugin is sort of like a Stash, but is better suited
for intra-plugin data sharing, using distro (not user) data.

Why use this?  To provide a standard set of information to other Git plugins easily, especially if the repo data is non-standard, or if
you need more than one set of data.
